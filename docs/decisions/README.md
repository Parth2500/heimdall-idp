# Decision records

The current decisions are in the decision tables: D1 to D44 in the [threat model](../threat-model.md), and U1 to U17 in the [front-end design](../frontend-design.md). A table shows only what is true now.

A decision record keeps the history. Each record is one change to a decision: what was true before, what is true after, and the reason. A correction to the first draft also gets a record. A new decision gets a row in its table and no record.

## Rules

- Write a record in the same commit as the change.
- Do not change a record after its commit, except to set its status to "Superseded" and name the new record.
- Use the next number. Keep the sections: Before, After, Reason, Consequences.
- Name who decided: the owner, or Claude with the owner's go-ahead.
